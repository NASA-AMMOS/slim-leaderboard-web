## Quick Start

This guide provides a quick way to get started with our project. Please see our [docs]([INSERT LINK TO DOCS SITE / WIKI HERE]) for a more comprehensive overview.

### Requirements

* Python 3.11 or higher
* pip (Python package manager)
* Git (for submodules)
* GitHub Personal Access Token (for API access)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository with submodules:**
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/slim-leaderboard-web.git
   cd slim-leaderboard-web
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install SLIM Leaderboard:**
   ```bash
   cd slim-leaderboard
   pip install -e .
   cd ..
   ```

4. **Set your GitHub token (recommended):**
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token_here"
   ```
   
   This allows the server to handle analysis without requiring users to provide tokens.

### Run Instructions

#### Option 1: Direct Python
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"  # Optional but recommended
python app.py
```

#### Option 2: Using the production script
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"  # Optional but recommended
bash run_production.sh
```

#### Option 3: Using Docker
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"
docker-compose up
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:8081

### Usage Examples

1. **Analyze a single repository:**
   - Select "Single Repository" from the dropdown
   - Enter repository URL: `https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/slim-detect-secrets`
   - Choose output format (e.g., Table)
   - Click "Analyze"

2. **Analyze an entire organization:**
   - Select "Entire Organization" from the dropdown  
   - Enter organization URL: `https://github.com/nasa-ammos`
   - Choose output format and options
   - Click "Analyze"

3. **Using your own token (for higher rate limits):**
   - Enter your GitHub Personal Access Token in the optional field
   - This overrides the server's token for your analysis

### Docker Build Instructions

1. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t slim-leaderboard-web .
   ```

2. **Run the container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8081:8081 -e GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token" slim-leaderboard-web
   ```

### Test Instructions

1. **Test the API endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/analyze \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "repository_url": "https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/slim-detect-secrets",
       "target_type": "repository",
       "output_format": "TABLE"
     }'
   ```

2. **Test the health check:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8081/api/health
   ```
